# Intune with Cloud Attach  
_Architecture & Deployment Guide_

---

## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains the **‚ÄúCloud Attach Architecture‚Äù** document, which details the design, deployment, and operational considerations for integrating Microsoft Intune with Cloud Attach (tenant attach/co-management) in a server environment. It is aimed at infrastructure, security, and operations teams who need a reference for planning and executing a Cloud Attach rollout.

## üìÇ Repository Contents  


- **Cloud-Attach-Architecture.docx**  
  The main Word document covering:

  1. **Introduction & Goals**  
     - Objectives, scope, and high-level benefits (security, unified management, compliance).  
     - Functional/non-functional requirements and quality goals aligned to Microsoft‚Äôs Well-Architected Framework.

  2. **System Scope & Context**  
     - Supported Windows Server versions.  
     - High-level system diagram showing components: Configuration Manager, Intune, Defender for Endpoint, Entra ID, on-prem servers, cloud resources.

  3. **Solution Strategy & Architecture Decisions**  
     - Tenant Attach vs. Co-management.  
     - Key decisions: Device enrollment, conditional access, security posture, unified management.  
     - In-scope workloads: Endpoint Protection (Defender suite).

  4. **Deployment View**  
     - Phased rollout plan (Pilot ‚Üí Tier 3 ‚Üí Tier 2 ‚Üí Tier 1).  
     - Pre-requisites (network URLs, Configuration Manager version, permissions, licensing).  
     - Detailed step-by-step tasks for:  
       - Enabling Cloud Attach  
       - Creating collections  
       - Deploying servers to Defender  
       - Enrollment validation  
       - Use-case applicability matrix

  5. **Cross-Cutting Concepts**  
     - Compliance (CIS Benchmarks, encryption, server hardening).  
     - Identity & access controls (Entra ID policies, conditional access).  
     - Logging/monitoring guidelines.

  6. **FinOps**  
     - Cost estimates for resource roles/time.  
     - Licensing requirements (Intune Plan 2).

  7. **Infrastructure & Operations**  
     - Service-level expectations (99.9‚Äì99.99% availability).  
     - Patching, configuration management, separation of duties, logging.

  8. **Quality Assurance**  
     - Testing methodology (baseline MDE policy, application-specific policies).  
     - Sample test cases and success criteria.

  9. **General Architectural Concerns**  
     - Scalability, resiliency, disaster recovery targets, RTO/RPO.

  10. **Appendix**  
      - Reference links (ASR, role permissions, CIS benchmarks).

- **diagrams/**  
  (Optional) Folder for any PNG/SVG diagrams referenced in the document (e.g., high-level system diagram, deployment roadmap).
